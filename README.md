- The app was originally made to have a Next.js frontend and a Flask backend to process the form data.
Even though it ran when working on it using localhost, due to a lack of access to a domain I had to 
default to making a static application with no backend.

- The App asks the user to enter some information after which it processes it and prints back the results.
It's quite a small application but I learned some very useful things, especially how to communicate a 
front-end application such as this with a back end using Flask.

- The actual Application can be accessed following this [link](https://go-fare-calculator-nextjs.vercel.app/)
